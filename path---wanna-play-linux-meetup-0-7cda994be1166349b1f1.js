Therefore, to provide the community members an introduction to the Linux command line and the various basic commands of Linux, OSDC organized the “Wanna-Play-Linux Meetup” on 30th August,2018.</p>\n<p>It started with an introductory talk by <a href="https://github.com/crapsystem">Himanshu Nailwal</a> about the six stages of using Linux and some basic Linux commands. Adding to this, in order to make the learning process more interactive, a customised live disk was created which contained 11 levels, each of which contained a flag/password to the next level. The users had to find that flag using some basic commands like <code class="language-text">cat</code> ,<code class="language-text">ls -a</code>, <code class="language-text">grep</code>, <code class="language-text">find</code>,<code class="language-text">tar</code> etc. in order to navigate their way to the next level and ultimately to the end.</p>\n<p>Bringing their hacking skills to the forefront, everyone and even the newcomers tried their best to decipher the flags level by level. This approach of learning by doing was highly appreciated by all the community members.</p>\n<p>This wargame simulation was followed by a QnA session in which the community members clarified their various doubts regarding using Linux and its distros. The meetup finally ended with a lot of awesome stuff learnt and done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Want to know how to create a customised live disk?
